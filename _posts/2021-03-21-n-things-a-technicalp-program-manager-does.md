title: The nine things a (technical) program manager does

---

After five-plus years as a Product Manager, I recently became a founding member of GitHub's newly established Technical Program Management organization. Program Management is a new label for me, even if the underlying responsibilities are not. So what the heck does a Program Manager actually do?

### Program manager vs. Product Manager vs. Project Manager

"PM" is an overloaded acronym within the software industry, with the roles it represents varying drastically from organization to organization. Here's a brief disambiguation:

#### Product Manager vs. Program Manager

I've [written before](https://ben.balter.com/2016/06/06/twelve-things-a-product-manager-does/) about what a Product Manager does. In short, a Product Manager is customer focused while a Program Manager is execution focused:

* Product Managers - Product Managers are responsible for understanding the needs of customers and distilling those needs into a prioritized list of product requirements. Depending on an organization's size or maturity a Product Manager may take on some program management responsibilities, but it's not their core function.
* Program Managers - Program Managers are specialists of and responsible for the cross-functional and cross-organizational planning and coordination, risk management, and process tracking, that gets the product out the door. Program Managers may inform product decisions, but they do not directly shape products or features.

#### Program Manager vs. Project Manager

In the traditional sense, a program manager is a people manager that manages one or more project managers. More recently, you'll see program managers that manage a collection of inter-connected projects, even if they don't have any direct reports. Program management versus project management can often be seen through the lens of strategic versus tactical, but there is no bight line between the two as more senior project managers naturally take on more projects or more complex projects which can often be seen as (or become) programs.

#### Program Manager vs. Technical Program Manager

In short, Technical Program Managers are technical. They don't write code on a day-to-day basis,[^1] but they are at home rolling up their sleeves and diving deep into technical discussions alongside engineers and other subject-matter experts. A technical degree is not strictly necessary, but TPMs are systems thinkers that have a keen understanding of the product and the platform, and may have previously been an engineer or a product manager for a highly-technical product.

Here’s my list of the nine most important things a program manager can do on any given day:

### 1. Communication, coordination, and facilitation

Although this role may have some necessary overlap with Product Management, Program Managers specialize in this particular function. As [I wrote of Product Managers](https://ben.balter.com/2016/06/06/twelve-things-a-product-manager-does/) (with slight modification):

> Your team should focus on shipping. You should focus on all the meta-work necessary to create the space that allows that to happen. That means memorializing synchronous meetings, shuttling information to other affected teams, and coordinating cross-team efforts (and overcoming any organizational friction that may arise as a result). At GitHub, we have the idea of servant leadership. As a [program] manager, your job is to provide your team with the all political, yak-shaving, and unblocking air cover necessary so that they can focus exclusively on shipping. Make sure other teams know what you’re up to, are able to opt-in to additional context if they’d like, and harmonize any supporting or parallel efforts across the organization. You should be the most organized person on your team, and be able to tell, at any given moment, exactly what needs to be done to get the [deliverable] shipped (and to make sure that is exactly what happens).

### 2. Capture and track the work that needs to be done

Planning and tracking are the core competency of program (and project) management. What's the universe of work that needs to get done for the program to be successful? When do we need to do the work by? In what order should we do it? Who's responsible for each deliverable? Are there any external dependencies? Do we have everything we need? And once the work is captured, it's the responsibility of the TPM to track each work stream's progress, to ensure the real-world work accurately reflects what's planned and vise versa.

### 3. Identify, analyze, and mitigate program risk

Whereas Product and Engineering Managers think in terms of problems and solutions, if there's one thing that defines the shift from another technology role to Program Management, it's the shift to thinking in terms of risks and mitigations.

At the end of the day, a program manager is responsible for the program's successful execution. That means working with functional leads to tease out risks to each work stream's success (risk identification), defining the problem space to understand the risk's program impact (risk analysis), and finally identifying and implementing mitigations to minimize the impact of those risks and maximizing the chance of program success (risk mitigation). 

### 4. Reporting up and across

If a TPM has one direct deliverable, it's to ensure that there are no surprises. That means providing day-to-day and week-to-week situational awareness both to leadership and to those responsible for program deliverables. TPMs should make program execution boring, or at least predictable.

One unique aspect about being a TPM is that you're responsible for execution, not the outcome. That means that you're uniquely incentivized to report the no-BS truth on the ground. Functional leads may shy away from brining light to a problem area or unmitigated risk, but increasing visibility regardless of (or despite) status is one of the primary ways TPMs can bring value to a program.

### 5. Remove blockers


### 6. Resolve conflict

Conflict avoidance is a natural outgrowth of relationship-driven corporate culture. When you work with someone on a regular basis or depend on them for the success of your own deliverables, it's understandable not to want to wade directly into a potentially volatile subject, real or perceived. But teams do have divergent (and often conflicting) priorities. Individuals do make mistakes and communicate imperfectly. Ambiguity often arises where responsibilities overlap and teams interface with one another. Sometimes people just plain don't like each other.

As a TPM, your role is to force those tough conversations, to bring things out into the open, and problems into the light. TPMs play the role of the trusted third-party that can facilitate a productive and solution-oriented conversation on neutral ground where all parties feel heard and their interests represented. This takes groundwork ahead of time to build the trust and relationships and a level head in the moment to keep conversations focused on the program's success.

### 7. Drive consensus

/alignment/clarity / reduce ambiguity/squishiness/ 

Surfaces decisions which need to be made - * Enable LT and DRIs to make tradeoffs / resource allocate properly

### 8. Boundryless engagement 


catch issues and tasks without clear ownership

cross-functional program dependencies

### 9.  Doing what needs to be done (code, inter-personal conflict, organization, etc.)




That said, the TPM role is only a few months old at GitHub, and I'm confident it will continue to evolve as the organization grows and matures. 

[^1]: Successful TPMs may find themselves regularly writing non-production "manager code" to automate common administrative tasks and help scale their own efforts.
