title: N things a (technical) program manager does
description:
---

After five-plus years as a Product Manager, I recently became a founding member of GitHub's new Technical Program Management organization. Program Management is a new label for me, even if the concept is not. So what the heck does a Program Manager do?

### Program manager vs. Product Manager vs. Project Manager

"PM" is an overloaded acronym within the software industry, with the roles it represents varying drastically from organization to organization. Here's a brief disambiguation:

#### Product Manager vs. Program Manager

I've [written before](https://ben.balter.com/2016/06/06/twelve-things-a-product-manager-does/) about what a Product Manager does. In short, a Product Manager is customer focused while a Program Manager is execution focused:

* Product Managers - Product Managers are responsible for understanding the needs of customers and distilling those needs into a prioritized list of product requirements. Depending on an organization's size or maturity a Product Manager may take on some program management responsibilities, but it's not their core function.
* Program Managers - Program Managers are specialists of and responsible for the cross-functional and cross-organizational planning and coordination, risk management, and process tracking, that gets the product out the door. Program Managers may inform product decisions, but they do not directly shape products or features.

#### Program Manager vs. Project Manager

In the traditional sense, a program manager is a people manager that manages one or more project managers. More recently, you'll see program managers that manage a collection of inter-connected projects, even if they don't have any direct reports. Program management versus project management can often be seen through the lens of strategic versus tactical, but there is no bight line between the two as more senior project managers naturally take on more projects or more complex projects which can often be seen as (or become) programs.

#### Program Manager vs. Technical Program Manager

In short, Technical Program Managers are technical. They don't write code on a day-to-day basis,[^1] but they are at home rolling up their sleeves and diving deep into technical discussions alongside engineers and other subject-matter experts. A technical degree is not strictly necessary, but TPMs are systems thinkers that have a keen understanding of the product and the platform, and may have previously been an engineer or a product manager for a highly-technical product.

Here’s my list of the N most important things a program manager can do on any given day:


### 1. Communication, coordination, and facilitation

Although this function may have some necessary overlap with Product Management, Program Managers specialize in this role. As [I wrote of Product Managers](https://ben.balter.com/2016/06/06/twelve-things-a-product-manager-does/) (with slight modification):

> Your team should focus on shipping. You should focus on all the meta-work necessary to create the space that allows that to happen. That means memorializing synchronous meetings, shuttling information to other affected teams, and coordinating cross-team efforts (and overcoming any organizational friction that may arise as a result). At GitHub, we have the idea of servant leadership. As a [program] manager, your job is to provide your team with the all political, yak-shaving, and unblocking air cover necessary so that they can focus exclusively on shipping. Make sure other teams know what you’re up to, are able to opt-in to additional context if they’d like, and harmonize any supporting or parallel efforts across the organization. You should be the most organized person on your team, and be able to tell, at any given moment, exactly what needs to be done to get the [deliverable] shipped (and to make sure that is exactly what happens).

2. Capture and track the work that needs to be done
3. Identify risk / define problem
4. Reporting up and across / increase visibility regardless of status
5. Remove blockers
6. Resolve conflict - Force the tough conversations / bring things out the open
7. Drive consensus/alignment/clarity / reduce ambiguity/squishiness/ 
8. Boundryless engagement - catch issues and tasks without clear ownership
9.  Doing what needs to be done (code, inter-personal conflict, organization, etc.)

providing situational awareness  - Ensure no surprises

No BS, truth on the ground


cross-functional, cross-organizational planning and coordination, risk management, and process tracking. 

Surfaces decisions which need to be made - * Enable LT and DRIs to make tradeoffs / resource allocate properly

cross-functional program dependencies

[^1]: Successful TPMs may find themselves regularly writing non-production "manager code" to automate common administrative tasks and help scale their own efforts.
