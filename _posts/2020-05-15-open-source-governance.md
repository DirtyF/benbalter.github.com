*This post is the third in a series on successfully managing open source communities at scale.*

### Organization-owned

Open source projects of a certain maturity should be organization-owned. There a few reasons for this. First, many of GitHub's best community management tools are exclusive to organization-owned repositories. This is a feature intended to reduce the administrative complexity for smaller hobby projects that don't yet need advanced features like community content reporting. Second, organization-owned projects allow for a distributed ownership model. Rather then having a single "owner" with the ability to grant `write` permission to collaborators, organization-owned projects can have multiple admins, and benefit from more granular permissions like the triage and maintainer roles, allowing you to spread responsibilities across more contributors at various levels. You'll also gain the benefit of teams to organize contributors, allowing you to create @mentionable affinity groups for components or specialized domains such as accessability or security.

### Enforce two-factor authentication

Supply chain attacks are a reality of modern software development. Without two-factor authentication (2FA), a reused password could lead to malicious code slipping into your next release, or if you use GitHub Actions or other CI/CD systems, compromised secrets (and the systems they access as a result). While [you should, of course, enable 2FA on your own account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication), if you grant contributors elevated permissions to your project, ensure they have 2FA enabled themselves, by [requiring a second authentication factor as a condition of organization membership](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization).

### Triage role

In 2019, GitHub [introduced the `triage` role](https://github.blog/2019-10-03-delegate-responsibilities-with-expanded-repository-permissions/) to help maintainers share the burden of community management with the community. If a contributor proves their ability to drive technical discussions or lead development of your project, you can empower them to take on additional issue management responsibilities without needing to also grant the ability to modify your projectâ€™s source code or change potentially destructive repository settings. Specifically, contributors with the `triage` role can help keep things in your project organized by managing labels (such as adding `bug` or `feature` label), issue state (close, reopen, assign), milestones, pull request reviews, discussions, and marking issues as duplicate so that maintainers can focus on the trickier governance problems facing the project. Best of all, the `triage` role does not afford `write` project access, so it can be granted more liberally, with little risk to the code itself.

### Advanced features

Two other community management adjacent features are worth calling out here to help streamline project governance:

1. **Code owners** - [Code owners](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners) (one of GitHub's most underutilized features, in my opinion), allow you to designate teams as "owners" of certain parts of the code base. When a pull request is opened against a matching file, the team is automatically notified via a requested review, and if you enable branch protection (see below), optionally, they could be required to approve the pull request before the "owned" file can be modified. This allows you to distribute ownership and review responsibilities across teams, while also making granting `write` access less risky for lesser-known contributors.
2. **Branch protection** - [Protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches), allows you to set rules for when a branch (most often your primary branch) can be modified. You can require status checks to pass or reviews to be completed before a pull request is eligible to be merged. Along with code owners, this gives you further confidence to grant expanded community permissions, taking confidence in robot and human review occurring before code can be modified, even by contributors with `write` access.
