title: Managing open source communities at scale
description: A rollup of my advice for successfully managing open source communities at scale.
---

Following my rule that [everything should have a URL](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/), in response to a prominent international organization asking for guidance as they made their first forray into the world of open source with a high-visibility pandemic-related project, I captured my advice into a series of four posts on successfully managing open source communities at scale:

1. [Set open source contributors up for success](https://ben.balter.com/2020/05/15/set-open-source-contributors-up-for-success/)
2. [Automate common open source community management tasks](https://ben.balter.com/2020/08/10/automate-common-open-source-community-management-tasks/)
3. [Open source governance](#)
4. [Moderating open source conversations to keep them productive](#)

I hope that these posts can help set other organizations up for success as they take a similar plunge in joining the open source community. If you (or your organization) is new to open source, you might also want to check out these additional, more "vintage" resources:

* [Tips for growing communities around your open source project](https://ben.balter.com/2017/11/10/twelve-tips-for-growing-communities-around-your-open-source-project/)
* [Internal collaboration best practices](https://ben.balter.com/2015/03/08/open-source-best-practices-internal-collaboration/)
* [External engagement best practices](https://ben.balter.com/2015/03/17/open-source-best-practices-external-engagement/)

Last, if "the lawyers" are giving you a hard time, I've also offered some more tactical advice around [open source licensing](https://ben.balter.com/2017/11/28/everything-an-open-source-maintainer-might-need-to-know-about-open-source-licensing/) (including why you shouldn't [write your own license](https://ben.balter.com/2016/08/01/why-you-shouldnt-write-your-own-open-source-license/)), 
[copyright notices](https://ben.balter.com/2015/06/03/copyright-notices-for-websites-and-open-source-projects/), and [why you shouldn't require a contributor license agreement](https://ben.balter.com/2018/01/02/why-you-probably-shouldnt-add-a-cla-to-your-open-source-project/).
