[In 2011](https://ben.balter.com/2011/09/07/analysis-of-federal-executive-domains/), the White House’s Office of Management and Budget recently released a list of all domains owned and operated by federal executive agencies. At the time, I used a tool I wrote called [Site Inspector](https://github.com/benbalter/Site-Inspector) to sniff out information about each government domain's technology and capabilities. I also conducted subsequent scans in [2014](https://ben.balter.com/2014/07/07/analysis-of-federal-executive-domains-part-deux/) and [2015](https://ben.balter.com/2015/05/11/third-analysis-of-federal-executive-dotgovs/). Now, nearly ten years after that first crawl, I conducted a fourth analysis of federal .gov domains to serve as a snapshot of the state of government technology ahead of the incoming Biden administration.

You can [browse the results](https://ben.balter.com/2021-analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains/), download the raw data as [CSV](https://ben.balter.com/2021-analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains/data.csv), or [JSON](https://ben.balter.com/2021-analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains/data.json), see a [breakdown by technology](https://ben.balter.com/2021-analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains/technologies/), or [view detailed results for an individual domain](https://ben.balter.com/2021-analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains/domains/whitehouse-gov/).
